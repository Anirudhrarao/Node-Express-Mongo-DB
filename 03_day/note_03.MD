## üìò What is Express.js?

> **Express.js** is a **minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework**

- You can define **routes easily** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
    
- Handle **requests and responses** with minimal setup
    
- Add **middleware** for authentication, logging, etc.
    
- Serve **HTML pages**, **JSON APIs**, or static files
